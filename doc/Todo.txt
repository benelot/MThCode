ToDo
- Formalism on PP to show
- evaluate different trained models
- gradient norm plot for sigmoid vs tanh
- clarify difference of u as output to r as output
- maybe evaluate a model with all inputs while training
- look at teacher forceing
- sleep annotation


Questions
- Bias?
- Normalization?
- Activation function?
- All Outputs and from past or few outputs and from others?
- How train to not overfitt one position?
