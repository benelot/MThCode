- iEEG Data Analysis: Correlation, clustermap, various patients, spectrogram.
- RNN: Vizualize weights, rotate inputs/outputs (pattern compleiton, wait on Beni), compare no linear output layer to one linear output layer (how do the weights change?).
- Theory: Why is normalization so important? Should I ignore it nevertheless?
- Theory: How to interpret weights as synaptic strength? What about bias training?
