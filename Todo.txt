ToDo:

- Scaler
-- Scaling should equally effect all channels.
-- Choose gauss-scaler over MinMaxScaler.

- Bias
-- Introduce bias interpreted as shift in AF.

- Statistics!
-- Show conclusion always with confidence bands (use various    initialisations of weights).

- Do experiment over larger periods of time (-5 min).

- Why is the diagonal so negative?
-- Calculate a difference.

- Do experiment on different sleep stages (Wake, REM, NREM, etc.).



Tasks:

(1) Show basic findings.
	(1.1) Get solid architecture.
		- Scaler
		- Bias
		- Check for parallel model (for longer periods of time)
		- Shortly check for non-linear behavior
			(Scatterplot correlation)
	(1.2) Analyze.
		- Negative diagonal? (It is still '0'?)
	(1.3) Find good statistical methods.
	(1.4) Conduct experiments.

(2) Further experiments.
	(2.1) Variation in sleep stages.
	(2.2) Variation in freq. bands.
	(2.3) Experiment with architecture.
		- Additional Weights/AFs
		- Learnable AFs
