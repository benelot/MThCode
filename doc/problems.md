## Problems

#### Fundamental problems

* Plausibility of ANN as neural population network.
* Plausibility of iEEG as network output.



#### Correspondence problems (biological - artificial)

* Correspondence of $\mathbf{r}^{(t)}$, $\mathbf{u}^{(t)}$, $\mathbf{W}$,  and $\phi$.
  * What is firing rate?
* What constraints come with correspondence?
* Problem of normalizing the inputs.



#### Technical problems

* How to enhance general performance?
* Performance with $\phi$ correspondence constraints.

  * Try modified $\sigma$.
* Dynamics of full-semi-recurrence.

  * Why is small $\lambda$ and higher numbers of hidden nodes better?

  * Maybe constraint recurrent term to not be to small.
* Dynamics of output  $\mathbf{u}^{(t)}$ before $\phi$.
  * Toy-model for analyzation.


* Introduction of dropout nodes?
* Number of hidden nodes.

  * Try on train data if 120 is still better.
