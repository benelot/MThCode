# Master Thesis Code
This repository contains all code used for the master thesis "Reverse-engineering the connectome from iEEG to reveal synaptic homeostasis in sleep" by Jan Segessenmann (2020).

The `main.py` file trains some models on iEEG data. Functions for iEEG analysis can be found in `ieeg_utilities.py`.

The required packages are listed in "required_packages.txt" and download links to the required data are listed in "data_download.txt". Make sure to move the downloaded data to /data and execute /code/main.py.


Further iEEG recordings can be downloaded here: http://ieeg-swez.ethz.ch/.
